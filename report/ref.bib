@article{RANSAC,
	abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/ smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.},

@article{LORANSAC,
	abstract = {A new enhancement of ransac, the locally optimized ransac (lo-ransac), is introduced. It has been observed that, to find an optimal solution (with a given probability), the number of samples drawn in ransac is significantly higher than predicted from the mathematical model. This is due to the incorrect assumption, that a model with parameters computed from an outlier-free sample is consistent with all inliers. The assumption rarely holds in practice. The locally optimized ransac makes no new assumptions about the data, on the contrary – it makes the above-mentioned assumption valid by applying local optimization to the solution estimated from the random sample. The performance of the improved ransac is evaluated in a number of epipolar geometry and homography estimation experiments. Compared with standard ransac, the speed-up achieved is two to three fold and the quality of the solution (measured by the number of inliers) is increased by 10-20\%. The number of samples drawn is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

@article{eightpoint_fundamental,
    abstract = {The fundamental matrix is a basic tool in the analysis of scenes taken with two uncalibrated cameras, and the 8 point algorithm is a frequently cited method for computing the fundamental matrix from a set of 8 or more point matches. It has the advantage of simplicity of implementation. The prevailing view is, however, that it is extremely susceptible to noise and hence virtually useless for most purposes. The paper challenges that view, by showing that by preceding the algorithm with a very simple normalization (translation and scaling) of the coordinates of the matched points, results are obtained comparable with the best iterative algorithms. This improved performance is justified by theory and verified by extensive experiments on real images},
