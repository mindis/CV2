@article{RANSAC,
	abstract = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/ smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented.},

@article{LORANSAC,
	abstract = {A new enhancement of ransac, the locally optimized ransac (lo-ransac), is introduced. It has been observed that, to find an optimal solution (with a given probability), the number of samples drawn in ransac is significantly higher than predicted from the mathematical model. This is due to the incorrect assumption, that a model with parameters computed from an outlier-free sample is consistent with all inliers. The assumption rarely holds in practice. The locally optimized ransac makes no new assumptions about the data, on the contrary – it makes the above-mentioned assumption valid by applying local optimization to the solution estimated from the random sample. The performance of the improved ransac is evaluated in a number of epipolar geometry and homography estimation experiments. Compared with standard ransac, the speed-up achieved is two to three fold and the quality of the solution (measured by the number of inliers) is increased by 10-20\%. The number of samples drawn is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},
