\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
In this report wel will discuss the process we went through to make a 3D reconstruction from a set of photos. To do this we will use multiple techniques, including, keypoint extraction \cite{SIFT}, keypoint matching \cite{FLANN_based_matcher}, Structure from Motion \cite{SfM} and \fixme{Assignment4 technique?}.
In Section \ref{matching} we will discuss how we extracted featurepoints from an image. In Section \ref{structure} we will show how we used Structure from Motion to generate a 3D point cloud. In Section \fixme{The part about the last assignment}. Section \ref{experiments} will detail the results of the techniques used in this report.
