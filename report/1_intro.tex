\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
In this report wel will discuss the process we went through to make a 3D reconstruction from a set of photos. To do this we will use multiple techniques, including, keypoint extraction \cite{SIFT}, keypoint matching, Structure from Motion \cite{SfM} and ICP \cite{ICP}.
In Section \ref{matching} we will discuss how we extracted featurepoints from an image. In Section \ref{structure} we will show how we used Structure from Motion to generate a 3D point cloud. In Section \ref{ICP} we discuss a technique that we have used to try and refine the 3D point clouds.
