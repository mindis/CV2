\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this report we have shown how we have worked to create a 3D reconstruction of a teddy bear using Structure from Motion and ICP. 
The Structure from motion worked and shows some definite resemblance to the actual 3D model of the teddy bear.
However the final result using ICP does not show this resemblance anymore.
This is because it probably is not the right technique to use for this case.
